                    The Department of Computer Science belongs to the Faculty of Science, which is one of the five faculties under the College of Basic and Applied Sciences (CBAS) of the University of Ghana. The Faculty of Science was established in 1963 as part of the then Faculty of Science and Agriculture. In 1974, the Faculty of Science and Agriculture was split into two faculties: the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Agriculture. The Faculty of Science was further restructured in 2014, when the University of Ghana adopted the collegiate system of governance. The Faculty of Science consists of five schools, namely:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>School of Biological Sciences</li>
                    <li>School of Engineering Sciences</li>
                    <li>School of Nuclear and Allied Sciences</li>
                    <li>School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences</li>
                    <li>School of Veterinary Medicine</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Faculty of Science is committed to providing high quality education, research, and innovation in various fields of science and technology, and to contributing to the national and global development agenda.The Faculty of Science has a vision to become a centre of excellence in science and technology education, research, and outreach in Africa and beyond. The Faculty of Science has a mission to produce graduates who are well-equipped with scientific knowledge, skills, and values, and who can apply them to solve problems and create opportunities in various sectors and industries. The Faculty of Science also strives to generate and disseminate scientific knowledge and innovations that can address the challenges and opportunities of the society and the environment.

                <h3>History of the Faculty</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="faculty-paragraph">
                <p>
                    The history of the Faculty of Science can be traced back to the establishment of the University of Ghana in 1948 as the University College of the Gold Coast. The University College of the Gold Coast was an affiliate college of the University of London, which supervised its academic programs and awarded degrees. The University College of the Gold Coast offered courses in arts, social sciences, law, and basic science. The basic science courses included physics, chemistry, mathematics, botany, and zoology. The first batch of students who enrolled in the basic science courses in 1948 were 33 in number. The first Principal of the University College of the Gold Coast was Mr. David Mowbray Balme, who was also a lecturer in physics. The first Dean of the Faculty of Science was Professor J. B. S. Haldane, who was a renowned geneticist and evolutionary biologist. The first Ghanaian Dean of the Faculty of Science was Professor Alexander Kwapong, who was also the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ghana.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The University College of the Gold Coast became the University College of Ghana in 1957, when Ghana gained independence from Britain. The University College of Ghana became the University of Ghana in 1961, when it gained full university status and the right to award its own degrees. The University of Ghana expanded its academic programs and faculties, and established new schools and institutes. The Faculty of Science also grew in size and scope, and introduced new courses and departments, such as biochemistry, geology, computer science, engineering, nuclear science, and veterinary medicine. The Faculty of Science also established collaborations and partnerships with other local and international institutions, such as the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, and the University of Cape Coast. The Faculty of Science also produced many distinguished graduates and scholars, who have made significant contributions to the fields of science and technology, and to the development of Ghana and the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Faculty of Science underwent a major restructuring in 2014, when the University of Ghana adopted the collegiate system of governance. The Faculty of Science became part of the College of Basic and Applied Sciences (CBAS), which also includes the School of Agriculture and the School of Medicine and Dentistry. The Faculty of Science was divided into five schools, each with its own dean and administration. The Faculty of Science also revised its curriculum and programs, to meet the changing needs and demands of the society and the industry. The Faculty of Science continues to uphold its vision, mission, and values, and to pursue excellence in science and technology education, research, and innovation.
