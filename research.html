                    Research in the department of computer science is driven by the curiosity and creativity of the faculty and students, who work on various aspects of computing and its applications. The department has a strong culture of collaboration, both within and outside the university, and encourages interdisciplinary research that can address the grand challenges of our time. The department also fosters a close relationship with the industry, and provides opportunities for students to engage in real-world projects and internships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The department has several research groups, each focusing on a specific area of computer science, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, software engineering, computer networks, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and more. Each research group is led by one or more faculty members, and consists of graduate students, undergraduate students, and sometimes postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars. The research groups meet regularly to discuss their ongoing research, share ideas, and provide feedback to each other. The research groups also organize seminars, workshops, and conferences to disseminate their research findings and interact with other researchers in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The department offers various research degrees, such as MPhil, MSc, and PhD, as well as research-oriented courses for undergraduate students. The research degrees require students to conduct original and independent research under the supervision of a faculty member, and to write and defend a thesis or dissertation. The research-oriented courses allow undergraduate students to participate in research projects, learn research methods and skills, and write research papers or reports. The department also supports students to publish their research in reputable journals and conferences, and to apply for scholarships and grants to fund their research.
